# Node.js Local Modules Learning Examples

Welcome to the **Node.js Local Modules Learning Repository!**
This repository contains various examples demonstrating how to use local modules in Node.js to structure and modularize applications efficiently.

## Introduction

This repository is designed to help **beginners** understand the concept of **local modules** in Node.js.  
By organizing core functionalities into reusable modules, developers can write **cleaner, more maintainable code**.  

The examples in this repository cover topics such as:

- Setting up your first Node.js application
- Fetching command-line arguments
- Creating an HTTP server
- Using and organizing modules

## Installation

To get started with this project:

### 1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:vselva/nodejs.git
```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
```sh
cd nodejs
```

### 3. Run any example file using the following command:
```sh
node <file-name>.js
```

1. Welcome.Js
A basic application to print a message using console.log

2. PrintArgs.Js
Demonstrates how to fetch command-line arguments using the global process object.

3. GreeUser.Js
Takes a command-line argument (name), converts it to Title Case, and greets the user.

4. BasicHttpServer1.Js
Creates a simple HTTP server using the built-in http module that sends a text response.

5. BasicHttpServer2.Js
Enhances the HTTP server to send HTML responses based on the URL path.

6. MathOps.Js
Imports the math.js module to perform arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.

7. Circle.Js
Imports the circle.js module to perform circle-related calculations like area and circumference.
